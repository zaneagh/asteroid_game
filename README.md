# Asteroid Game
Here is the super simple asteroif game that I made as a part of the boot dev course

# Running Game
You have to run the virtual enivonrment before you can run any pythong commands.
To run the virtual environment, run the following command:
```
 source venv/bin/activate
 ```
 Note to self: Make sure you are in the project directory when running this command. It should end in asteroid_game

 # Project Structure
 Then main game loop is sitting in the main.py file. Most of the rest is pretty self
 explanatory. But I'll add more details as this continues to grow.
