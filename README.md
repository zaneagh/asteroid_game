# Asteroid Game
Here is the super simple asteroif game that I made as a part of the boot dev course

# Running Game
You have to run the virtual enivonrment before you can run any pythong commands.
To run the virtual environment, run the following command:
```
 source venv/bin/activate
 ```
 Note to self: Make sure you are in the project directory when running this command. It should end in asteroif_game
